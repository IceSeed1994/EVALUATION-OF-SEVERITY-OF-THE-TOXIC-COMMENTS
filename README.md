# Evaluation of toxicity of russian comments

Abstract—The evaluation of toxic comment severity in online platforms demands efficient methods. Deep Learning (DL) models offer an automated approach by understanding language patterns
and context. DL models use the steps of dataset gathering, annotation, and preprocessing to determine the severity of toxic comments. Scalable options for automated content moderation
and resource prioritization are offered by DL models. By identifying the underlying traits of toxic comments, they support interventions, guidelines, and education. DL models offer
automated solutions for content moderation and are promising in assessing the severity of toxic comments. Fair evaluations depend on addressing biases and ensuring model interpretability.
Continued research and collaboration will foster a safer online environment.

## I. Introduction

Toxicity in online platforms has become a pressing issue in
today’s digital age. The prevalence of toxic comments, which
include offensive, abusive, or harassing language, can have
detrimental effects on individuals and communities. Identifying
and evaluating the severity of such toxic comments is a
crucial step in fostering healthier online environments.
Traditional methods for identifying toxic comments often
rely on manual moderation or keyword-based filters, which
can be time-consuming and ineffective. However, advancements
in deep learning techniques offer promising solutions
for automated toxicity classification, leveraging the power of
natural language processing (NLP) and LSTM networks. Deep
learning models can learn intricate patterns and contextual
cues from large amounts of text data, enabling them to
accurately assess the severity of toxic comments.

## II. MAIN PART

### Methodology:
Data Collection:
1) Collect a large dataset of online content that contains
hate speech.
2) Annotate the dataset to indicate the severity of the hate
speech.
3) Include information about the context, language used,
and target of the hate speech.

Data Preprocessing:
1) Clean the text data to remove noise, such as HTML tags,
URLs, and special characters.
2) Tokenize the text into individual words or subword units.
3) Extract relevant features from the text, such as n-grams,
sentiment scores, or topic modeling.

Model Development:
1) Choose an appropriate deep learning algorithm for hate
speech classification, such as LSTM, CNN, or transformer
models like BERT.
2) Design the model architecture, including the layers,
activations, and connections.
3) Regularize the model to prevent overfitting, using techniques
like dropout, regularization, or early stopping.

Model Evaluation:
1) Evaluate the trained model using various performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2) Analyze the model’s confusion matrix to understand
the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false
positives, and false negatives.
3) Assess the model’s ability to generalize by evaluating
its performance on the test set.


### LSTM:

LSTM was specifically chosen due to its suitability for
handling sequential data. In the task of analyzing toxic comments,
understanding the context and dependencies of previous
inputs is crucial. LSTM’s design enables it to capture longterm
dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited
for this task.
Another advantage of LSTM is its memory retention capability.
The algorithm incorporates memory cells that can
retain information over long sequences. In the context of
toxic comment classification, considering the entire comment
is necessary for accurate toxicity classification. LSTM’s memory
retention helps capture important information from the
comments and retain it for further analysis.
